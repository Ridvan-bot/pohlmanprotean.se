## Project Overview

This project is a TypeScript Next.js application for the **PohlmanProtean** website. The primary URL for production is [pohlmanprotean.se](https://pohlmanprotean.se), with the development environment accessible at [dev.pohlmanprotean.se](https://dev.pohlmanprotean.se).

## Environments

The project is hosted in Google Cloud with continuous deployment handled by GitHub workflows.

| Environment   | URL                                      | Description            |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Production    | [pohlmanprotean.se](https://pohlmanprotean.se)         | Live production site   |
| Development   | [dev.pohlmanprotean.se](https://dev.pohlmanprotean.se) | Staging for new changes |

### Deployment Workflow

- **Production**: Automatically deployed from the `main` branch to the production URL.
- **Development**: Automatically deployed from the `dev` branch to the development URL.

The GitHub workflow file responsible for deployments is located at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** - React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **TypeScript** - Superset of JavaScript with static typing.

## Deployment 
Automatic Deployment with GitHub Workflows
This project uses GitHub Actions to handle automatic deployments:

Production: Any push to the main branch triggers a deployment to pohlmanprotean.se.
Development: Any push to the dev branch triggers a deployment to dev.pohlmanprotean.se.
The deployment process is defined in .github/workflows/deploy.yml.

Make sure you create a project in Google Gloud Run before you try to commit any code to a repo.
Once you pushed the code, and if it failes, make sure the service account in Google Cloud has all the permission it needs.
These are the Permissions:

Viewer, Cloud Run Admin, Cloud Build Editor, Service Account User, Storage Admin, Artifact Registry Writer, Registry Administrator.

If you are new to Google Cloud Run, and you are using the free trail, make sure you enable billing.
